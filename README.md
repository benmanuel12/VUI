# VUI
This is a 3rd year university project in which I made a voice user interface to help computer science students
My project allows users to submit text files using the h1(#) and h3(###) Markdown tags and then ask the software to search for specific words by voice command
It was also planned to allow Google searches as well as Github initialisations and commits but the API and legal issues of these tasks rendered them hard to add before the deadline

I have uploaded the code to heroku too (https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/vui-test) and I can turn it on if you contact me. I only have the free version so I cannot afford to leave it on at all times
